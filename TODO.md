# ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES:
- when spawing overlapping colliders they explode
- weird error message when closing window
- restitution unreliability
---

# ‚úÖ DONE:

- graphics
    - basic animation system
        - truly moving animated sprites
    - add imgui
- collision
    - collision optimization
        - collision idle state
- graphics
    - resizable window
    - render system abstraction
    - basic animation system
        - animated sprites
        - finite state machine animated sprite switching
- collision
    - collision triggers
- separate threads for rendering, physics and the rest
- constraints as components
- sprites (color, texRect, origin, render pipeline)

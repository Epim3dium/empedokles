# 📌 DOING:

---

# ⚠️ ISSUES:
- weird error message when closing window
- non resizable window
- restitution unreliability
---

# ✅ DONE:
- separate threads for rendering, physics and the rest
- constraints as components
- sprites (color, texRect, origin, render pipeline)

- ##### basics of rendering system
- ##### basics of collision system
- ##### basics of ECS system

# Empedokles
A work-in-progress game engine based on custom ECS, rendered using Vulkan API.
My dream project of an engine able to run interactive live simulations of fluid, solid and liquid.

### üéØ Requirements (Target)
* Basic animation system either bone or sprite based
* Interactive simulation of:
    * Liquid 
    * Solid
    * Fluid
    * Rigidbody
* Interaction between simulation systems
* Cross platform
* Single-player (for now)
* min req: M1 mac (without GPU it should work on anything else)
### üìê Specification
* simulations working at runtime (60FPS) (for the cost of precision which I am able to sacrifice)
* controls using keyboard and mouse
### üé® Art & Design
* Pixelart
* Can be very simplistic
### ‚úÖ DONE:
- custom ECS where every entity is just a number
    - registering of more components
    - registering of more systems
    - custom system onEnitityAdded/removed
- collision
    - basic of collision detection & resolution using XPBD
    - added more constraints
        - anchored swivel
        - unanchored swivel
        - anchored fixed 
        - unanchored fixed 
    - optimization
        - broad phase
        - idle state
    - triggers
- graphics
    - gui - mainly for debugging for now
    - resizable window
    - render system abstraction
    - basic animation system
        - animated sprites
        - finite state machine animated sprite switching
    - abstraction of all basic components (Textures, RenderSystems etc.)
    - work ready compute pipeline
    - compute-updated particle system
- basic editor
- constraints as components

### </> Implementation
* C++ as I need very good performance for all the simulation systems
* git for version control
* Main game logic uses hand crafted Entity Component System for speed and flexibility.
    * example of creating a platform through code:
```c++
uint32_t platform = ECS.createEntity();
ECS.addComponent(
        platform, Transform(position, rotation, scale)
);
auto col = Collider(platform_shape);
col.collider_layer = GROUND;
ECS.addComponent(platform, col);
ECS.addComponent(platform, Rigidbody{ .isStatic = true });
ECS.addComponent(platform, Material());
auto model = Model("platform_debug");
model.color = {0.05, 0.15, 0.05, 1};
ECS.addComponent(platform, model);
```
adding a new component/system is as easy as:

```c++
ECS.registerComponent<TestComponent>();
ECS.registerSystem<TestSystem>();
```
* Rendering done from the ground up using vulkan. (Huge thanks to awesome guides: [vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) and [vkguide](https://vkguide.dev/))
* dependancies:
    * [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) as a math library, because implementation of all the math functions would be very time consuming.
    * [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) for graphics for high level access to GPU and corss-platform compatibility
    * [stb image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) to read different types of graphic files and [tiny obj loader](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader) for .obj files - not fun to code up myself, not my aim with this project
    * [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for GUIs, once again - not my aim to make a great GUI system, it's more of an addon
    * [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit tests

### Evolution:
* I am now aware that running evey simulation on a single thread, on the CPU might be unfeasable, started working on compute shaders for fluid simulation.
* Added unit tests, feel like it's useful to be sure the backbone structure works before any manual testing
